# FY-Beginner-Projects

**Description:**  
This repository contains small programming exercises developed during my first year of B.Tech. The goal is to practice programming fundamentals, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Projects include beginner-level C programs demonstrating basic logic, arithmetic operations, and simple user interaction.

## Projects

1. **calculator.c** – Basic arithmetic calculator performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
2. **age_calculator.c** – Calculates age based on user input (day, month, year).  
3. **even-odd-number-printer.c** – Computes electricity bill based on units consumed using simple logic.  
4. **multi_functionality_calculator.c** – An even-odd number printer in C which takes inputs from the user and prints the output in the table format. 
5. **chatbot.c** – A simple chatbot demonstrating basic input/output interaction and conditional responses in C.
